      <p>The year is 2072. The enemy has removed all burgers from the planet. At least, supposedly.</p>
      <p>Rumor has it that a legendary Cat Burger lives out in the Haunted Woods. You know, the woods that are haunted? Anyways, he can supposedly grant unlimited burgers to anyone courageous enough to seek him out.</p>
      <p>Will you brave the Haunted Woods and find the legendary Cat Burger?</p>

      <p>Awesome, let's get to work.</p>
      <p>The Haunted Woods are full of ghosts, and people have a penchant for getting lost forever.</p>
      <p>As you enter the woods, call out for the Cat Burger. Click in the woods to call out for him. But be careful! If you call too many times, evil spirits may find you and trap you in the Haunted Woods forever. Your remaining attempts are listed in the lower right hand corner.</p>
      <p>Just a warning, ghosts haunt every corner of the woods. The legendary Cat Burger is hopefully out there, but ghosts definitely are. They are known for feasting on the blood and flesh of their victims.</p>
      <p>Be careful out there.</p>
